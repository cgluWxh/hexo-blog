- Ten Principles of Economics

	- Marginal Change: A small incremental adjustment to an existing plan of action.

	- Prices:

		- Determined by interaction of buyers and sellers

		- Reflect the good's value to society

		- Reflect the cost of producing the goods

	- Invisible Handby Adam Smith:

		- Prices guide self-interested households and  firms to make decisions that maximize society's economic well-being.

	- Gov: Enforce property rights.

	- Externality & Market Power -> Market Failure

	- The Circular-Flow Diagram
		
		Figure

		A visual model of the economy, shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms
		
		Two types of "actors"
		Households
		Own the factors of production, sell/rent them to firms for income
		
		Buy and consume goods& services
		
		Firms
		Buy/hire factors of production, use them to produce goods and services
		
		Sell goods & services
		
		Include two markets
		The market for goods and services
		
		The market for "factors of production"

	- Positive and Normative Statement

		- Positive Statement: 描述现在是什么, 可以被证伪（Evaluated by analyzing data; Can be Confirmed or Refuted）

		- Normative Statement: 描述将来怎么样, 不可以被证伪（Evaluated using data, value judgments, views on ethics, region, political）

- The Production Possibilities Frontier

	- PPF Example
		
		（*现在同样的资源, 可造5000小麦或者500电脑, 电脑难造小麦容易造）
		
		当这条线越靠近Y轴, 斜率越大时（比如X轴截距100, 说明现在的资源可造5000小麦或100电脑）, 说明X轴表示的东西变得更难获得、Y轴表示的东西变得更容易获得, X轴的Opportunity Cost变大, Y轴的Opportunity Cost变小
		
		当这条线越靠近X轴, 斜率越小时（比如X轴截距600, 说明现在的资源可造5000小麦或600电脑）, 说明X轴表示的东西变得容易获得、Y轴表示的东西变得更难获得, X轴的Opportunity Cost变小, Y轴的Opportunity Cost变大
		
		总结
		靠近哪个轴这哪个轴东西容易获得, Oppurtunity Cost小 例
		
		斜率代表的是X轴所代表物品的Opportunity Cost
		
		PPF becomes steeper and the opportunity cost of  mountain bikes increases

	- 表述：The opportunity cost of A in terms of B

	- Outward是凸的, Inward是凹的, Feasible是可以达到的

	- Usually bentoutward: due to the law of increasing opportunity cost

		- Resources suited to computer production are used in the car industry.

		- Technological advance in producing one thing: Move one endpoint while another stays the same.

	- Points under PPF: Not efficient(widespread unemployment); Points above PPF: Not feasible.

- Comparative Advantage (-> Specialization)

	- Abs advantage: Produce with fewer inputs (can have in both goods)

	- Have lower opportunity cost than another producer (impossible to have in both goods)$$Opportunity\ Cost\ of\ A=\frac{1}{Opportunity\ Cost\ of\ B}$$

	- The Price of the Trade: Must lie between their opportunity costs.

	- Comparative Advantage -> Exports; Else Imports

	- International trade can make some individuals worse off, even as it makes the country as a whole better off; Same comparative advantage -> No gains

- Demand & Supply

	- Demand:

		- Price Up; Quantity Down

		- Shift:

			- Increase -> Right; Decrease -> Left

			- Shifters:

				- Income

					- Normal Goods:((An increase in income leads to an increase in demand))

					- Inferior Goods:((An increase in income leads to a decrease in demand))

				- Prices of Related Goods

					- Substitutes: A's price Up, A's demand Down; B's demand Up

					- Complements: A's Price Up, A's demand Down; B's demand Down

				- Tastes

				- Expectations

					- Expect income Up; Current demand Up

					- Expect price Up; Current demand Up

				- Number of Buyers

			- Price of the good itself -> a movement along the demand curve

	- Supply:

		- Price Up; Quantity Up

		- Shift:

			- Increase -> Right; Decrease -> Left

			- Shifters:

				- Input Prices: Input price Up; The supply Down

				- Technology: Advance in Technology, Cost Down; Supply Up

				- Expectations: Expect Price Up in the future, Supply Down Today (put some of its current production into storage)

				- Number of Sellers

			- Price of the good itself represents a movement along the curve

	- Equilibrium Price (Marketing-clearing Price)

		- Surplus:$$Q_S > Q_D$$Price Down

		- Shortage:$$Q_D>Q_S$$Price Up

- Elasticity

	- Price Elasticity of Demand

		- How much the$$Q^d$$responds to a change in price

		- If we say it is free to enter/leave the market, elasticity ishigh.

		- Determinants

			- Avaiability of Close Substitutes: With close substitutes -> High Elasticity

			- Necessities -> Inelastic; Luxuries -> Elastic

			- Definition Narrow -> Elastic; Broad -> Inelastic

			- Longer time horizons -> Elastic

		- $$Price\ Elasticity\ of\ Demand = \frac{ \%\ change\ in\ Q_D}{\%\ change\ in\ Price}=\frac{\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{\frac{1}{2}(Q_2+Q_1)}}{\frac{P_2-P_1}{\frac{1}{2}(P_2+P_1)}} = \frac{(Q_2-Q_1)(P_2+P_1)}{(Q_2+Q_1)(P_2-P_1)}=\frac{P}{Q} \times \frac{1}{\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q} } = \frac{P}{Q} \times \frac{1}{k}$$

			- Whenkis a constant, (P up Q down) -> Elasticity Up.

				- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/d21b992b-e878-4081-8faf-24e46b52f6d3.png)

			- AlwaysPOSITIVE

		- Variety: Elastic(>1); Unit Elastic(=1); Inelastic(<1)

		- 注：想象Inelastic的I是竖直的, 所以竖线是Perfect Inelastic, Elasticity为0. 故斜率越大越Inelastic, 斜率越小越Elastic,  为0是横线Perfect Elastic, Elasticity为无穷

		- Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand

			- Inelastic: Price Up, Revenue Up; Elastic: Price Up, Revenue Down; Unit Elastic: Price Change, Total Revenue Remains Constant

	- The Income Elasticity of Demand

		- $$Income\ Elasticity\ of\ Demand = \frac{ \%\ change\ in\ Q_D}{\%\ change\ in\ Income}$$

		- Normal Goods: Positive

			- Necessities: Small

			- Luxuries: Large

		- Inferior Goods: Negative

	- The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

		- $$CrossPrice\ Elasticity\ of\ Demand = \frac{\%\ change\ Q_D\ of\ A}{\%\ change\ P\ of\ B}$$

		- Substitutes: Positive; Complements: Negative

	- The Price Elasticity of Supply

		- Determinants: The flexibility of sellers to change the amount of the good they produce (Easy to change, Elasticity Up)

		- More elastic in the long run than short

		- $$Price\ Elasticity\ of\ Supply=\frac{\%\ change\ in\ Q_S}{\%\ change\ in\ P}$$

- Consumer and Producer Surplus

	- Consumer Surplus

		- $$CS=WTP-P\ (*Always\ \ge 0)$$

		- The area below D-curve and above the Price.

		- Lower Price -> Additional consumer surplus to initial consumers + Consumer surplus to new consumers

	- Producer Surplus

		- $$PS=P-Cost$$

			- Cost: The value of everything a seller must give up to produce a good. *Lowest price / Producer's willingess to sell his services

		- The area below the Price and above the S-curve.

		- Higher Price -> Additional producer surplus to initial producers + Producer surplus to new producers

	- Market Efficiency

		- $$Total\ Surplus=Consumer\ Surplus+Producer\ Surplus=Value\ to\ Buyers-Cost\ to
			\ Sellers$$

		- Efficiency -> Maximize Total Surplus received by all members

		- Equality -> Distributing Economic Prosperity Uniformly Among the members of Society

- Government Intervention

	- Price ceiling / Price floor

		- Binding 才是有效的, 即 Ceiling 高需低于 Eq'm Price 方为 Binding, Floor 需高于 Eq'm Price

		- DWL: Triangle Area

		- Labor Market: Price Floor means minimum wage.  So minimum wage causes a labor surplus(unemployment).

		- Price ceiling -> Shortage. In the long run, supply and demand are more price-elastic. Shortage is larger.

			- -> Sellers must ration the goods among the buyers.

				- Long lines; Discrimination according to sellers' biases -> Often unfair and inefficient (goods do not go to buyers who value the goods most)

		- Apartment Rent, in the short run, we haveperfect inelastic supply.

	- Taxes

		- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/0e6be9cd-bc05-4dd8-81f4-ffd81d54fd8d.png)

		- Discourage Market Activity. Eq'm Quantity Down.

		- $$Tax\ Revenue=Tax \times New\ Eq'm\ Quantity$$

		- DWL: The fall in total surplus that results from a market distortion. Triangle Area.

		- Elasticity & Tax Burden

			- Buyers/Sellers who havelower elasticitywill have alarger tax burden. A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic. Because fewer good alternatives and less willing to leave the market.

		- Thegreatertheelasticitiesof supply and demand, thelargerthedeadweight losscaused by the tax.

	- The Determinants of Trade

		- Word Price > Domestic Price -> Export (Opp cost low)
			Word Price < Domestic Price -> Import (Opp cost high)

		- For Exporting Country:
			Domestic producers better off
			Domestic consumers worse off
			Economic well-being Up

		- For Importing Country:
			Domestic consumers better off
			Domestic producers worse off
			Economic well-being Up

		- Tariff (Works forimporter)

			- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/b5f356db-e594-4608-b21a-4b5d57f0ec5f.png)

			- a tax on imported goods

			- Causes DWL(Overproduction & Underconsumption). Best policy for eficiency is to allow trade without a tariff.

	- Price Support

		- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/6bbe2d90-9e7a-4728-98a6-5729803b1023.png)

		- Price Supports
			
			$$\Delta Welfare=D-(Q_2-Q_1)\times P_S$$
			
			$$\Delta PS = A+B+D$$
			
			$$\Delta CS=-A-B$$
			
			$$Gov\ Buy=Q_2-Q_1$$
			
			$$Gov\ Cost= (Q_2-Q_1)\times P_S $$

	- Production Quotas

		- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/a89b35ca-a357-4ded-8e06-46b3c2f1773b.png)

		- $$\Delta Welfare=-(B+C)$$

	- Incentive Program

		- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/a89b35ca-a357-4ded-8e06-46b3c2f1773b.png)

		- $$Min\ Incentive=B+C+D\\ \Delta CS=-(A+B)\\ \Delta PS=(A+B+D)\\ \Delta Welfare=-(B+C)$$

- Externality

	- Gov correct byinternalize the externality

		- Negative Externalities:$$Q^* < Q_{Market}$$, Tax

		- Positive Externalities:$$Q^* > Q_{Market}$$, Subsidize

	- Public Policies towards Externalities

		- Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation (Req/Forbid)

		- Market-based Policy: Corrective Taxes (Pigouvian Taxes) & Subsidies

			- $$Ideal\ Corrective\ Tax/Subsidy = External\ Cost/Benefit$$

			- Rather than causing DWL, actually makes the economy work better

		- Tradable Pollution Permits

			- Corrective Tax: Sets the price of pollution; Pollution: Perfectly elastic

			- Pollution Permits: Sets the quantity of pollution; Pollution: Perfectly inelastic

	- Private Solutions to Externalities

		- Moral Codes & Social Sanctions
			Charities
			Merge/Contract

		- The Coase Theorem

			- Bargain without cost over the allocation of resources -> Solve the problem of externalities on their own

			- Do NOT Work when

				- Transaction Costs are high.

				- A beneficial aggrement exists. Each party may hold out for a better deal.

				- The number of interested parties is large -> reaching efficient is difficult.

- Public Goods and Common Resources

	- Excludability: 一个人是否可以被阻止使用

	- Rivalry in consumption: 一个人用是否使他人使用减少

	- 四种分类（Congested: Rival; Toll: Excludable）



			- Rival

			- Not Rival

		- Excludable

			- Private Goods

				- Congested Toll Roads

			- Club Goods

				- Uncongested Toll Roads

		- Not Excludable

			- Common Resources

				- Congested Nontoll Roads

			- Public Goods

				- Uncongested Nontoll Roads

	- ((Public Goods))underprovided

		- The Free-Rider Problem

		- e.g. National Defense; Basic Research(General Knowledge)

		- Cost-benefit analyses are imprecise (Fair cost-sharing & Truthful Reporting)

	- ((Common Resources))overconsumed

		- The Tragedy of the Commons: People neglect the external cost -> overuse

		- e.g. Clean Air and Water; Fish, Whales and Other Wildlife

		- Regulate; Corrective Tax; Permits; Convert to private

- Consumer Theory

	- The Budget Constraint

		- Limit on the consumption (bundles/combination) a consumer can afford

		- Slope:$$Relative\ Price=\frac{P_x}{P_y}$$

		- $$P_x\ x + P_y \ y=I$$

	- Indifference Curves

		- Bundles giving the consumer the same level of satisfaction.

		- Slope:$$MRS=\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}$$(Marginal Rate of Substitution)

			- 他想要用几个Y轴商品换一个X轴商品, 越大说明不想要Y想要X, 越小说明不想要X想要Y. 

			- Example: 在此点由于斜率是大的, 说明MRS是大的. 此时我有少少的x, $$MU_x$$大, 多多的y, $$MU_y$$小. 此时$$MRS=\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}$$是大的. 

		- Assumptions:

			- Completeness: Consumers can compare and rank all possible baskets

			- Transitivity: Preferences are transitive.

			- More is better than less: Higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones.

			- -> Properties

				- Higher is better.

				- Slope downward.

				- Do not cross.

				- Bowed inward.

		- Types:

			- Perfect Substitutes: MRS fixed, Straight lines

			- Close substitutes: not very bowed

			- Perfect Complements: MRS 0/Inf, L-shaped, right-angle

			- Close complements: very bowed

	- Utility

		- Score of satisfaction

		- Utility Function: a set of indiference curves each with anumerical indicator$$U(x,y)=2x+y \Rightarrow MU_x=2,\ MU_y=1$$

		- Marginal Utility(MU): Additioinal satisfaction from 1 additional unit of a good

			- Diminishing Marginal Utility: More consumed, less additions to utility from additional amounts

		- At the optimum:$$\frac{MU_x}{P_x} =\frac{MU_y}{P_y}$$

			- If$$\frac{MU_x}{P_x} \gt \frac{MU_y}{P_y}$$, that means the marginal utility from an additional unit of x is larger than that of y, so we spend more on x. As we haveDiminishing Marginal Utility,$$\frac{MU_x}{P_x} \downarrow$$, finally they equal and we are at the optimum.

			- So$$MRS=\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}=Relative\ Price=\frac{P_x}{P_y}$$

- Production Theory

	- Factors

		- Production Technology

		- Cost Constraints

		- Input Choices

	- Prod Func: highest output that a firm can produce for every specified combination of inputs$$q=f(K,L)$$

	- Production with Labor Variable

		- $$Marginal\ Product \gt Average\ Product \Rightarrow AP \uparrow\\ MP=AP \Rightarrow AP_{max}\\MP=0 \Rightarrow TP_{max}$$

		- Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns

			- Assume that all labor inputs are of equal quality

	- Production with Two Variable Inputs

		- Isoquants

			- All possible combinations of inputs to yield the same output. 我们总是把x轴为劳动力, y轴为资本

			- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/3d2f7509-fc73-4339-b796-606d69c150b0.png)

			- $$A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \Rightarrow Diminishing\ Marginal\ Returns\ to\ Labor$$第一次增加1劳动力多生产20, 第二次增加1劳动力只多生产15

			- $$D \rightarrow B \rightarrow E \Rightarrow Diminishing\ Marginal\ Returns\ to\ Capital$$第一次多增加1资本多生产20, 第二次15

			- Slope: Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution$$MRTS=\frac{MP_L}{MP_K}=-\frac{\Delta K}{\Delta L}$$

				- 几个Capital能顶得上1个Labor

			- Downward sloping and convex

			- Special Cases

				- Perfect Substitutes: Straight Lines; MRTS Constant

				- Fixed-proportions Production Function: L-shaped; One labor - One capital

			- Returns to Scale

				- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/5f79587f-b342-4a49-a5b8-ce8d8cfe759b.png)

		- Isocosts

			- Cost

				- $$TC=Explicit+Implicit\ Cost=FC+VC\\Econ\ Profit=TR-TC\\Acct\ Profit=TR-Explicit\ Cost$$

			- Marginal Cost:$$\uparrow Total\ Cost\ from\ 1\ extra\ unit\ Prod\\MC=\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$$

			- Marginal Cost corsses AVC and ATC at their minimum points.

			- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/ca611276-2a59-416e-b7d2-5828095152d5.png)

			- Sunk Cost: Expenditure that has been made and cannot be recovered. 不同于Fixed Cost, 不参与重大决策

			- Cost in the

				- Short Run: Some inputs are fixed.

					- The determinants of Short-Run Cost

						- $$MC=\frac{\Delta VC}{\Delta Q}=\frac{w\Delta L}{\Delta Q}=\frac{w}{\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}}=\frac{w}{MP_L}$$So$$MP_L \uparrow\ \Rightarrow MC \downarrow $$

						- $$Quantity\ of\ Labor \uparrow\ \Rightarrow MP_L \downarrow\ \Rightarrow\ MC\uparrow$$

				- Long Run: All inputs are variable.

					- $$User\ Cost\ of\ Capital=Economic\ Depreciation + (Interest\ Rate)\times(Value\ of\ Capital)$$

					- Rate(Per dollar of capital) = Depreciation rate + Interest Rate

					- Under competitive capital market: Rent rate = User cost = Price *Rate

			- Isocost Line

				- $$C=wL+rK\\K=\frac{C}{r}-\frac{w}{r}L$$

				- Optimum:$$MRTS=-\frac{\Delta K}{\Delta L}=\frac{MP_L}{MP_K}=\frac{w}{r}$$

				- If$$\frac{MP_L}{w} \gt \frac{MP_K}{r}$$, the firm will increase the use of labor and decrease the use of capital.$$Quantity\ of\ Labor \uparrow\ \Rightarrow MP_L \downarrow$$Finally we get to the optimum.

- Competitive Market

	- Assumption: Perfectly Competitive Market

		- Market with many buyers and sellers.

		- All the products are identical.

		- Firms can freely enter or exit the market.

	- -> For competitive firms,$$AR=MR=P$$

	- $$TR=PQ\\AR=\frac{TR}{Q}\\MR=\frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}\\Profit_{max}\ when\ MR=MC$$

	- MC determines Q at any price. The competitive firm'sShort-Run Supply Curveis the portion of itsMC Curvethat lies above theAVC Curve.

		- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/06d730cf219790c3dfad3b9453bf192d.png)

		- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/8e640654-0282-4f2f-9e89-d364bfe789fe.png)The firm choose to shut down if$$TR<VC\  \ P<AVC$$

			- After shutting down, still need to pay fixed cost.

			- In the short run, FC are sunk costs, thus FC should not matter in the short-run decision.

	- The competitive firm'sLong-Run Supply Curveis the portion of itsMC Curvethat lies above theATC Curve.

		- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/6a47b6f5-9ee2-4312-90d4-22acee85ad44.png)

		- Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market

			- The firm choose to exit if$$TR<TC\ \ P<ATC$$to enter if$$TR>TC\ \ P>ATC$$

				- After exit, 0 cost.

			- $$Profit=TR-TC=(P-ATC)\times Q$$

	- Firm![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/32a4c39c-ed47-4cad-b0a5-c700cefa870d.png)

	- The Supply Curve in a Competitive Market

		- The Short-Run: With a Fixed Number of Firms (Usually upward-sloping line)

		- The Long-Run: Market Supply with Entry and Exit

			- 因为有profit时就会有enter, supply增加price降低profit下降
				有loss时就会有exit,   supply减少price升高profit增加

			- $$Price=Marginal\ Cost=Average\ Total\ Cost$$

			- At the minimum of ATC

	- Why Zero Profit?

		- Profit includes all includes all implicit costs. So when econ profit is zero, acct profit is positive.

	- Why Long-Run Supply Curve Might Slope Upward?

		- Horizontal: All firms have identical costs, and costs do not change as other firms enter or exit the market.

		- Upward: Firms have diferent costs, or cost rise as firms enter the market.

			- The price in the market reflects the average total cost of the marginal firm.

- Monopoly

	- Types

		- Monopoly Resources

		- Government Regulation

		- Natural Monopolies

	- Increasing Q ->

		- Higher output raises revenue

		- Lower price reduces revenue

	- To sell a larger Q, the monopolist must reduce the price on all the units it sells. => Marginal revenue is less than the price of its good.

	- MR can be negative. Price effect on revenue outweighs the output effect.

	- $$Profit\ Maximization\ P>MR=MC\\ For\ a\ competitive\ firm:\ P=MR=MC$$

	- ![](https://notes.bilibiili.com/v2/data/images/505322/9ec186bb-f01e-49ae-b0bb-15082a5755fc.png)

	- 在"Monopoly quantity" 右侧的某一单位产量, 消费者愿意支付的价格高于企业生产该单位的成本, 但这一单位产量没有被生产出来, 这就造成了社会福利的损失, 累积起来就是图中的红色阴影部分. 

	- Price Regulation

	- The Effect of Tax

	- $$MR=\frac{\Delta R}{\Delta Q}=\frac{\Delta (PQ)}{\Delta Q}=P+Q \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q}=P+P(\frac{Q}{P})(\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q})=P+P(\frac{1}{E_d})=MC$$

	- $$P=\frac{MC}{1+\frac{1}{E_d}}$$

	- $$Markup=Lerner\ Index=\frac{P-MC}{P}=-\frac{1}{E_d}$$
